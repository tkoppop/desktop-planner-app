# My Personal Project

## A quick overview

The application so far will be a simple task planner with a monthly calender, a daily plan, and a todo list. 
You will be able to add and remove tasks that you need to do with ease, and have many difference GUIs to choose from. 
This program will feature a monthly view, a weekly view, and a daily view, with a todo list task bar to the side. 
Additionally you can shrink this planner so that you can only be a miniature version of the todo list.

This program is targeted towards students, or people with many tasks to complete daily. I will personally use this 
as my main task organizer when this project is completed.

This project interests me as I personally use many different planners to keep track of my projects. However everything
I have found online has often disappointed me in terms of its functionality and "premium" features. I have not found an 
application that allows me to turn on monthly, weekly, daily, and a todo list view at the same time, and to change and 
customize those views at will. Additionally, most of these planners require payment to unlock full functionality, 
I really want to make something simple and I can use.
